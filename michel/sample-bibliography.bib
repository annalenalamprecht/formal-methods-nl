@mastersthesis{Putten2018,
abstract = {One of the challenges in the specification and analysis of models for the design of manufacturing systems is the occurrence of events outside the control of the supervisor. Uncontrollable events are typically encountered in the description of (user) inputs, external disturbances, and exceptional behavior. This paper introduces an approach for the specification and performance analysis of manufacturing systems with partially- controllable behavior on two abstraction levels. Finite automata in terms of system activities are used to model the high abstraction level, where uncontrollability is modeled by the presence of uncontrollable events. Uncontrollability on the lower abstraction level is treated as an external disturbance to the automata. This is modeled using variables, which are added to the high-level automata in an extended finite automaton. For performance analysis, game-theoretic methods are employed to determine a guarantee to the lower-bound system performance. This result is also used in a new method to automatically compute a throughput-optimal controller which is robust to the uncontrollable behavior.},

The existence problem for a supervisor is reduced to finding the largest controllable language contained in a given legal language. Two examples are provided.},

abstract = {The mCRL2 language and supporting software provide a state-of-the-art tool suite for the verification of distributed systems. In this paper, we present the general principles, extrapolated from [7,8], which make us believe that mCRL2 can also be used for behavioral variability analysis of product families. The mCRL2 data language allows to smoothly deal with feature sets and attributes, its process language is sufficiently rich to model feature selection, as well as product behavior based on an FTS-like semantics. Because of the feature-orientation, our modeling strategy allows a natural refactoring of the semantic model of a product family into a parallel composition of components that reflects coherent sets of features. This opens the way for dedicated abstraction and reduction techniques that strengthen the prospect of a scalable verification approach to software product lines. In this paper, we sketch how to model product families in mCRL2 and how to apply a modular verification method, preparing the ground to further assess the scalability of our approach, in particular regarding model checking.

abstract = {The sophistication of all-wheel-drive (AWD) technology is approaching the point where the drive torque to each wheel can be independently controlled. This potentially offers vehicle handling enhancements similar to those provided by dynamic stability control, but without the inevitable reduction in vehicle acceleration. Independent control of AWD torque distribution would therefore be especially beneficial under acceleration close to the limit of stability. A vehicle model of a typical sports sedan was developed in Simulink, with fully independent control of torque distribution. Box–Behnken experimental design was employed to determine which torque distribution parameters have the greatest impact on the vehicle course and acceleration. A proportional-integral control strategy was implemented, applying yaw rate feedback to vary the front–rear torque distribution and lateral acceleration feedback to adjust the left–right distribution. The resulting system shows a significant improvement over conventional dr...},

This paper presents work in progress on the Southampton Driver Simulator on driver workload and the driver's ability to reclaim control from the Adaptive Cruise Control system in a malignant scenario. Previous studies suggest that there may be some cause for concern. This study shows a reduction in mental workload, within a secondary task paradigm, associated with operating Adaptive Cruise Control. This finding is contrary to previous research into Adaptive Cruise Control. Further, in line with other research, this study snows mat a third of the participants were unsuccessful in reclaiming control of the vehicle before a collision occurred. We suggest that more research and development effort needs to be spent on looking at the communication between Adaptive Cruise Control and the driver.},

For this, we explicitly incorporate feature expressions into the logics, allowing operators to select transitions and behavior restricted to specific products and subfamilies. We provide semantics for mu-Lf and mu-Lf' and relate the two new mu-calculi and mu-L to each other. Next, we focus on the analysis of SPL behavior and show how our formalism can be applied for product-based verification with mu-Lf as well as family-based verification with mu-Lf'. We illustrate by means of a toy example how properties can be model checked, exploiting an embedding of mu-Lf' into the mu-calculus with data.},

@article{Omg2010,
abstract = {This specification defines a general-purpose modeling language for systems engineering applications, called the OMG Systems Modeling Language (OMG SysML). Throughout the rest of the specification, the language will be referred to as SysML. SysML supports the specification, analysis, design, verification, and validation of a broad range of complex systems. These systems may include hardware, software, information, processes, personnel, and facilities. The origins of the SysML initiative can be traced to a strategic decision by the International Council on Systems Engineerings (INCOSE) Model Driven Systems Design workgroup in January 2001 to customize the Unified Modeling Language (UML) for systems engineering applications. This resulted in a collaborative effort between INCOSE and the Object Management Group (OMG), which maintains the UML specification, to jointly charter the OMG Systems Engineering Domain Special Interest Group (SE DSIG) in July 2001. The SE DSIG, with support from INCOSE and the ISO AP 233 workgroup, developed the requirements for the modeling language, which were subsequently issued by the OMG as part of the UML for Systems Engineering Request for Proposal (UML for SE RFP; OMG document ad/2003-03- 41) in March 2003. Currently it is common practice for systems engineers to use a wide range of modeling languages, tools, and techniques on large systems projects. In a manner similar to how UML unified the modeling languages used in the software industry, SysML is intended to unify the diverse modeling languages currently used by systems engineers. SysML reuses a subset of UML 2 and provides additional extensions needed to address the requirements in the UML for SE RFP. SysML uses the UML 2 extension mechanisms as further elaborated in Chapter 17, Profiles {\&} Model Libraries of this specification as the primary mechanism to specify the extensions to UML 2. Since SysML uses UML 2 as its foundation, systems engineers modeling with SysML and software engineers modeling with UML 2 will be able to collaborate on models of software-intensive systems. This will improve communication among the various stakeholders who participate in the systems development process and promote interoperability among modeling tools. It is anticipated that SysML will be customized to model domain-specific applications, such as automotive, aerospace, communication, and information systems.},

However, these are complex systems and a number of severe incidents involving such garages have been reported. Many of these are related to safety issues in software. We apply verification techniques to develop a software design for an automated parking garage. This design meets a number of safety requirements. We provide a software architecture that allows one to split implementation, safety and algorithmic aspects of the software. Consequently, we give a high-level description of the safety aspects and verify a number of safety requirements on this model. Also, we briefly discuss how this analysis is simplified by using a custom visualization tool. 1},

Simply put, a CACC system is a more sophisticated variant of cruise control. By a control architecture we mean a specific way of organizing the motion control and navigation functions performed by the cars. It is convenient to organize the functions into hierarchical layers. This way, a complex design problem is partitioned into a number of more manageable sub-problems that are addressed in separate layers. This paper discusses vehicle control requirements and maps them onto a layered control architecture. The formalization of the hierarchy is accomplished in terms of the specific functions accomplished by each layer and of the interfaces between layers. The implementation of the layers is discussed and illustrative examples are provided},

abstract = {Truck Platooning is the future of transportation in which trucks drive cooperatively at less than 1 second apart made possible by automated driving technology. Transportation companies benefit from lower fuel consumption and improvements in (driver) productivity, while society benefits from fewer accidents, safer traffic and less congested roads, and lower carbon emissions. In this TNO whitepaper, we explain what platooning is, what kind of benefits it brings for which parties in the supply chain, and the roadmap towards deployment of platooning on Dutch and European roads. Developments in the underlying Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) technology have been ongoing for years, yet wide- scale deployment of truck platooning is a system-wide innovation challenge that requires a concerted approach of all stakeholders in society. For instance, policy-makers have to contribute supporting legislation, regulators such as the RDW need to develop safety-focussed type approval methodologies, truck manufacturers and OEM should strive for plug-and-plug compatibility of platooning systems, insurance firms are required to develop new liability coverage schemes, and shippers can urge their carriers and logistics service providers to form as many platoons as possible and change their supply chains, while other road users need to learn to accommodate the two-truck road trains. Right now the political and econom ic climate is positive for a broad deployment of platooning as initial legislation amendments are proposed to allow testing and experimentation on Dutch roads. For this system-wide innovation, we suggest to establish an Shared Innovation Programme, based on open innovation principles. In the programme, we can jointly work towards commercial deployment of platooning to implement a safe, reliable and efficient two-truck platooning concept by 2020.},

McPal regulates the propagation of new behavior and guides the changes in the components and in their coordination. Here we show how McPal may delegate part of its control to local adaptation managers, created on-the-fly, allowing for distribution of the adaptation indeed. We illustrate the approach for the well-known example of the dining philosophers problem, by modeling migration from a deadlock-prone solution to a deadlock-free and starvation-free solution without any system quiescence. The system migration goes through various stages, exhibiting a shift of control among McPal and its helpers, and changing degrees of orchestrated and choreographic collaboration. The distributed system adaptation is formally verified using the mCRL2 model checker.},

abstract = {Adaptive cruise control (ACC) provides assistance to the driver in the task longitudinal control of their vehicle during motorway driving. The system controls the accelerator, engine powertrain and vehicle brakes to maintain a desired time-gap to the vehicle ahead. This research describes the results of a detailed microscopic simulation investigation into the potential impacts of ACC on motorway driving. In addition to simulation, real vehicle driving profiles, obtained from instrumented vehicle experiments in three European countries, have been used to compare real following behaviour with that of a simulated ACC equipped vehicle. This new approach has shown that following with an ACC system can provide considerable reductions in the variation of acceleration compared to manual driving. This indicates a potential comfort gain for the driver and environmental benefits. A number of critical situations in which ACC does not perform well have also been identified. The research also highlights the limitations of microscopic simulation in modelling the impacts of ACC because of the lack of understanding of the interaction between the driver and the ACC system relative to the traffic conditions.},

abstract = {We present Clafer (class, feature, reference), a class modeling language with first-class support for feature modeling. We designed Clafer as a concise notation for meta-models, feature models, mixtures of meta- and feature models (such as components with options), and models that couple feature models and meta-models via constraints (such as mapping feature configurations to component configurations or model templates). Clafer allows arranging models into multiple specialization and extension layers via constraints and inheritance. We identify several key mechanisms allowing a meta-modeling language to express feature models concisely. Clafer unifies basic modeling constructs, such as class, association, and property, into a single construct, called clafer. We provide the language with a formal semantics built in a structurally explicit way. The resulting semantics explains the meaning of hierarchical models whereby properties can be arbitrarily nested in the presence of inheritance and feature modeling constructs. The semantics also enables building consistent automated reasoning support for the language: To date, we implemented three reasoners for Clafer based on Alloy, Z3 SMT, and Choco3 CSP solvers. We show that Clafer meets its design objectives using examples and by comparing to other languages.},

abstract = {The time complexity of supervisory control design for a general class of problems is studied. It is shown to be very unlikely that a polynomial-time algorithm can be found when either (1) the plant is composed of m components running concurrently or (2) the set of legal behaviors is given by the intersection of n legal specifications. That is to say, in general, there is no way to avoid constructing a state space which has size exponential in m+n. It is suggested that, rather than discouraging future work in the field, this result should point researchers to more fruitful directions, namely, studying special cases of the problem, where certain structural properties possessed by the plant or specification lend themselves to more efficient algorithms for designing supervisory controls. As no background on the subject of computational complexity is assumed, we have tried to explain all the borrowed material in basic terms, so that this paper may serve as a tutorial for a system engineer not familiar with the subject.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 IFAC.Today's software systems need to adapt their behavior due to the changes in their operational environments and user requirements. To this end, an adaptive software performs a sequence of adaptations at runtime. Correctness of the behavior of an adaptive software system during dynamic adaptation is an important challenge along the way to realize correct adaptive systems. In this research, we model adaptation as a supervisory control problem and synthesize a controller that guides the behavior of a software system during adaptation. The system during adaptation is modeled using a graph transition system and properties to be enforced are specified using an automaton. To ensure correctness, we then synthesize a controller that imposes constraints on the system during adaptation.},

abstract = {In the supervisory control theory, a supervisor is generated based on given plant and specification models. The supervisor restricts the plant in order to fulfill the specifications. A problem that is typically encountered in industrial applications is that the resulting supervisor is not easily comprehensible for the users. To tackle this problem, we introduce an efficient method to characterize a supervisor by tractable logic conditions, referred to as guards, generated from the models. The guards express under which conditions an event is allowed to occur to fulfill the specifications. To obtain tractable guard expressions, we reduce them by exploiting the structure of the given models. In order to be able to handle complex systems efficiently, the models are symbolically represented by binary decision diagrams and all computations are performed on these data structures. The algorithms have been implemented in a supervisory control tool and applied to an industrially relevant example.},

@article{Gu2010,
abstract = {Software has bugs, and fixing those bugs pervades the software engineering process. It is folklore that bug fixes are often buggy themselves, resulting in bad fixes, either failing to fix a bug or creating new bugs. To confirm this folklore, we explored bug databases of the Ant, AspectJ, and Rhino projects, and found that bad fixes comprise as much as 9{\&}{\#}x025; of all bugs. Thus, detecting and correcting bad fixes is important for improving the quality and reliability of software. However, no prior work has systematically considered this bad fix problem, which this paper introduces and formalizes. In particular, the paper formalizes two criteria to determine whether a fix resolves a bug: coverage and disruption. The coverage of a fix measures the extent to which the fix correctly handles all inputs that may trigger a bug, while disruption measures the deviations from the program's intended behavior after the application of a fix. This paper also introduces a novel notion of distance-bounded weakest precondition as the basis for the developed practical techniques to compute the coverage and disruption of a fix. To validate our approach, we implemented Fixation, a prototype that automatically detects bad fixes for Java programs. When it detects a bad fix, Fixation returns an input that still triggers the bug or reports a newly introduced bug. Programmers can then use that bug-triggering input to refine or reformulate their fix. We manually extracted fixes drawn from real-world projects and evaluated Fixation against them: Fixation successfully detected the extracted bad fixes.},

This paper includes data for 528 additional vehicles tested as part of NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) for year 2001 through year 2008 ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ). The previous data included center -of- gravity location and mass moments-of-inertia for nearly all of the entries. The NCAP involves only the CG location measurements; so the vehicles listed in this paper do not have inertia data. This paper provides a brief discussion of the entries provided in the tabular listings as well as the accuracy of CG height measurements.},

Validation envi- ronments must be able to test multiple kinds of applications that belong to different domains and technologies. Since this wide validation spectrum is very difficult to cope with, validation environments are usually specialized in domains, programming languages, technologies, etc. However, it is possible to identify that the validation processes for differ- ent systems share a set of commonalities and variability points. This is a perfect framework to apply the software product line approach to develop domain specific valida- tion environments for testing specific products. In this pa- per we present our experience of applying software product lines to support the variability of validation environments. We illustrate our product-line experience of developing two domain-specific validation environments for two different case studies: digital TV and slots machines.},

Formal models play an important role here because they enable the use of various model-based analyses and early integration techniques and tools.

abstract = {This research paper deals with the design of adaptive cruise control (ACC) which was implemented on a passenger car using PID controller. An important feature of the newly based adaptive cruise control system is that, its ability to manage a competent inter-vehicle gap based on the speed of host vehicle and headway. There are three major inputs to the ACC system, that is, speed of host vehicle read from Memory unit, headway time set by driver, and actual gap measured by the Radar scanner. The system is been adapted with the velocity control at urban environments avoids mitigate possible accidents. This paper deals with the design, modulating, and estimation of the controllers performing actions on the longitudinal control of a car to accomplish stop-and-go manoeuvres.},

As the number of products of an SPL is potentially exponential in the number of its features, the model checking problem is harder than for single software. A practical way to face this exponential blow-up is to reuse common behaviour between products. We previously introduced Featured Transition Systems (FTS), a mathematical model that serves as a basis for efficient SPL model checking techniques. In this paper, we present ProVeLines, a product line of verifiers for SPLs that incorporates the results of over three years of research on formal verification of SPLs. Being itself a product line, our tool is flexible and extensible, and offers a wide range of solutions for SPL modelling and verification. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem of testing Software Product Lines (SPLs) is that variability enables the production of a large number of instances and it is difficult to construct and run test cases even for SPLs with a small number of variable features. Interacting features is a foundation of a fault model for SPLs, where faults are likely to be revealed at execution points where features exchange information with other features or influence one another. Therefore, a test adequacy criterion is to cover as many interactions among different features as possible, thus increasing the probability of finding bugs. Our approach combines a combinatorial designs algorithm for pairwise feature generation with model-based testing to reduce the size of the SPL required for comprehensive coverage of interacting features. We implemented our approach and applied it to an SPL from the automotive domain provided by one of our industrial partners. The results suggest that with our approach higher coverage of feature interactions is achieved at a fraction of cost when compared with a baseline approach of testing all feature interactions.

abstract = {A Dynamic Software Product Line (DSPL) aims at managing run-time adaptations of a software system. It is built on the assumption that context changes that require these adaptations at run-time can be anticipated at design-time. Therefore, the set of adaptation rules and the space of con- gurations in a DSPL are prede ned and xed at designtime. Yet, for large-scale and highly distributed systems, anticipating all relevant context changes during design-time is often not possible due to the uncertainty of how the context may change. Such design-time uncertainty therefore may mean that a DSPL lacks adaptation rules or con gurations to properly recon gure itself at run-time. We propose an adaptive system model to cope with design-time uncertainty in DSPLs. This model combines learning of adaptation rules with evolution of the DSPL con guration space. It takes particular account of the mutual dependencies between evolution and learning, such as using feedback from unsuccessful learning to trigger evolution. We describe concrete steps for learning and evolution to show how such feedback can be exploited. We illustrate the use of such a model with a running example from the cloud computing domain.},

In previous work, FTS models were monolithic in the sense that the modeller had to construct the full FTS model of the product line in its entirety. To allow for modularity of FTS models, we propose here a language for extending an existing FTS model with new features. We demonstrate the language using a running example and present results about the language's expressivity, commutativity of feature extensions, feature interactions, and resolution of such interactions.},

abstract = {The tire-force ellipse and tire-force circle (more frequently referred to as the friction ellipse and the friction circle, respectively) have been used for many years to qualitatively illustrate the concept of tire-road force interaction, particularly the force-limiting behavior for combined braking and steering (combined tire forces). Equations of the tire-force circle/ellipse, or, more specifically, the force limit envelope, in its idealized form have also been used in the development of quantitative models of combined tire forces used in vehicle dynamic simulation software. Comparisons of this idealized tire-force circle/ellipse using a simple bilinear tire force model and using actual tire data show that it provides only a limited, simplified notion of combined tire forces due to its lack of dependence upon the slip angle and traction slip.  Furthermore, these comparisons show that the idealized tire-force circle/ellipse does not represent actual tire behavior, even approximately, since it is incapable of modeling the nonlinear behavior of tires. For this reason, the idealized tire-force circle/ellipse should not be used as a quantitative tire-force model particularly because superior validated models of nonlinear behavior of tires exist and are widely available. Here a development is presented of a more realistic version of the tire-force circle/ellipse which incorporates slip angle, traction slip and the actual nonlinear tire-force. Because of the complexity of nonlinear tire force behavior the Fy - Fx forcerelationship is not a true ellipse and the force limit is dependent on the kinematic slip angle andtraction slip variables, . and s, respectively.},

abstract = {Abstract—As recognized by various engineering disciplines, formal models have the potential to support and speed up development of cyber-physical systems. They enable extensive functional and performance analysis of designs, including for- mal verification, and control code generation. There are two general approaches to application of formal models in engi- neering processes for the design of discrete-event controllers. Controllers are modeled, e.g. using sequence-based specifi- cations, and, subsequently, verified against relevant system properties, such as the absence of blocking or the compliance to defined interfaces. Alternatively, from formal models of system components and requirements (finite automata and state-based expressions) non-blocking controllers are synthesized satisfying the requirements per definition. In both cases, models used are suitable for automatic code generation. This paper discusses lessons learned from the integrated application of these two approaches to an industrial case study. The experiment shows that they are complementary and that it is possible to combine them in one engineering process to mutual advantage.},

As a side-study within a research project aimed at quantitative analysis that used such a case study, we have observed how the deployed systems enjoy a wide variety of different features. We have therefore applied variability analysis to define a family of bike-sharing systems, and we have sought support in available tools. We have so established a tool chain that includes (academic) tools that provide different functionalities regarding the analysis of software product lines, from feature modelling to product derivation and from quantitative evaluation of the attributes of products to model checking value-passing modal specifications. The tool chain is currently experimented inside the mentioned project as a complement to more sophisticated product-based analysis techniques. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is about producing a set of related products that share more commonalities than variabilities. Feature models are widely used for variability and commonality management in software product lines. Feature models are information models where a set of products are represented as a set of features in a single model. The automated analysis of feature models deals with the computer-aided extraction of information from feature models. The literature on this topic has contributed with a set of operations, techniques, tools and empirical results which have not been surveyed until now. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on the automated analysis of feature models 20 years after of their invention. This paper contributes by bringing together previously disparate streams of work to help shed light on this thriving area. We also present a conceptual framework to understand the different proposals as well as categorise future contributions. We finally discuss the different studies and propose some challenges to be faced in the future. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The central purpose of DSPL is to handle adaptability at runtime through variability management, as well as to maximize the reuse of components. Emerging domains such as the mobile applications and software-intensive embedded systems require changes and extensions to the design in terms of both functionality and adaptation capabilities. DSPL should also deal with the unavoidable changes, which reflect both user needs and execution environments. However, the evolution capability in DSPL so far has not been investigated in depth. In this paper, we report on an exploratory study aimed at evaluating the object- oriented and aspect-oriented solutions on DSPL evolutionary scenarios. In this empirical evaluation, the aspect-oriented so- lution yielded better results in terms of measurements such as Weighted Operations per Component (WOC), Lines Of Code (LOC), Lack of Cohesion Over Operations (LCOO), Coupling between components (CBC), and Response For a Class (RFC). The use of aspects indicates that it provides assets with lower complexity, lower coupling, and higher cohesion},

Examples of features are plug-ins for software packages or additional services o3ered by telecommunications providers. Many features override the default behaviour of the system, which may lead to unforeseen behaviour of the system; this is known as feature interaction. We propose a feature construct for de5ning features, and use it to provide a plug-and-play framework for exploring feature interactions. Our approach to the feature interaction problem has the following characteristics: • Features are treated as 5rst-class objects during the development phase. • A method is given for integrating a feature into a system description. It allows features to override existing behaviour of the system being developed. • A prototype tool has been developed for performing the integration. • Interactions between features may be witnessed. In principle, our approach is quite general and need not be tied to any particular system description language. In this paper, however, we develop the approach in the context of the SMV model checking system. We describe two case studies in detail: a lift system and a telephone system.},

abstract = {Function allocation is the design decision to determine which functions are to be performed by humans and which are to be performed by machines to achieve the required system goals, and it is closely related to the issue of automation. Some of the traditional strategies of function allocation include (a) assigning each function to the most capable agent (either human or machine), (b) allocating to machine every function that can be automated, and (c) finding an allocation scheme that ensures economical efficiency. However, such “who does what” decisions are not always appropriate from human factors viewpoints. This chapter clarifies why “who does what and when” considerations are necessary, and it explains the concept of adaptive automation in which the control of functions shifts between humans and machines dynamically, depending on environmental factors, operator workload, and performance. Who decides when the control of function must be shifted? That is one of the most crucial issues in adaptive automation. Letting the computer be in authority may conflict with the principle of human-centered automation which claims that the human must be maintained as the final authority over the automation. Qualitative discussions cannot solve the authority problem. This chapter proves the need for quantitative investigations with mathematical models, simulations, and experiments for a better understanding of the authority issue.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) is a set of software systems that have a particular set of common features and that satisfy the needs of a particular market segment or mission. The traditional SPLs focus on building software platforms at develop- ment time. In contrast, modern systems of emerging domains (e.g., ubiquitous computing, service robotics and autonomic systems) require new settings to perform dynamic reconfiguration. In this context, Dynamic Software Product Line (DSPL) extends the SPL concept to provide an efficient way to deal with software adaptation at runtime. A key artifact in SPL is the feature model. Such model is very important in the specification of SPLs, representing the variability of the software and also supporting the instantiation of applications. However, this model has some limitations regarding its usage in DSPL. In order to effectively provide dynamic reconfiguration of features, it is necessary to represent such model in a formal way thus it can be automatically monitored, retrieved and modified during the execution of a product. Hence, we propose an ontology for feature modeling, regarding its capabilities to handle changes in the feature models, demanding less effort to be reconfigurable at runtime. In order to illustrate the use of the ontology, a set of reconfiguration scenarios in the domain of ubiquitous computing are presented.},

abstract = {In supervisory control theory, an issue that often arises in real industrial applications is the huge number of states for the supervisor, which requires a lot of memory. Another problem that is typically encountered for the users of supervisory synthesis tools is lack of information and unreadability of the supervisor. In this paper, we introduce a method to characterize a controllable and non-blocking supervisor directly on the modular automata (sub-plants and sub-specifications), by extracting some guard conditions from the synthesized supervisor and the synchronized automaton. Thus, the presented approach may potentially model a complex supervisor using a compact representation whilst not infringe the original modular structure. Furthermore, the guard conditions, which are generated from a set of states, may give the user of the synthesis procedure a better understanding of which states that were removed during the synthesis. In order to obtain more compact guard expressions, we include some unnecessary states (unreachable and extended forbidden states) in the set of states that will be used for guard generation. By exploiting this extra information, it is possible to reduce the logical expressions to more compact guard conditions.},

abstract = {We study the design of distributed control for discrete-event systems (DES) in the framework of supervisory control theory.We view a DES as comprised of a group of agents, acting independently except for specifications on global (group) behavior. The central problem investigated is how to synthesize local con- trollers for individual agents such that the resultant controlled behavior is identical with that achieved by global supervision. In the case of small-scale DES, a supervisor localization algorithm is developed that solves the problem in a top-down fashion: first, compute a global supervisor, then decompose it to local controllers while preserving the global controlled behavior. In the case of large-scale DES where owing to state explosion a global supervisor might not be feasibly computable, a decomposition-aggregation solution procedure is developed that combines the supervisor localization algorithm with an efficient modular control theory.},

abstract = {In this paper, we deal with the development of dynamically reconfigurable embedded systems in terms of the production of execution schedules of system tasks (feasible configuration) under hard real-time constraints. Indeed, several real-time embedded systems must be dynamically reconfigured to account for hardware/software faults and/or maintain acceptable performances. Depending on the run-time environment, some reconfigurations might be unfeasible, i.e., they violate some real-time constraints of the system. More specifically, we propose an approach that starts from a set of reconfigurations to construct a Software Product Line (SPL) that can be reused in a predictive and organized way to derive real-time embedded systems. To make sure that the SPL offers various feasible reconfigurations, we define an intelligent agent (IA) that automatically checks the system's feasibility after a reconfiguration scenario is applied on a multiprocessor embedded system. This agent dynamically determines precious technical solutions to define a new product whenever a reconfiguration is unfeasible. The set of products thus defined by the agent can then be unified into an SPL. The originality of our approach is its capacity to extract, from the unfeasible configurations of an embedded system, an SPL design enriched with real-time constraints and modeled with a UML Marte profile. The SPL design can assist in the comprehension, reconfiguration as well as evolution of the SPL in order to satisfy real-time requirements and to obtain a feasible system under normal and overload conditions.},

abstract = {The AUTOSAR standard defines a seamless tool supported and model based methodology for ECU software design and engineering. Furthermore, the stan- dard specifies a technical infrastructure by means of standardized basic software modules for ECU networks, serving as a uniform implementation platform for AUTOSAR systems. The major challenges in automotive systems development not only arise as a result of the contiuously growing amount of functionality to be realized correctly, but also from the increasing number of quality requirements to be taken into account, e.g. safety, performance, and costs. The integration of approaches for early checking of correctness and quality criteria accompany- ing the different development phases makes a significant contribution towards coping with the complexity of such systems. We describe such a model based development process and a corresponding tool chain based on the V-modell and its embedding into the AUTOSAR methodology. For the validation of functional correctness systematic testing approaches are applied, and for quality criteria ac- cording evaluation methods are used. We discuss that especially in the context of AUTOSAR, the phase of architectural system design is crucial for the qual- ity properties of the system under development, and to what extent architecture evaluation can be used for quality estimation. The practices in the different devel- opment steps are illustrated in detail by means of a comprehensive, AUTOSAR compliant case study, i.e. a body comfort system. The tool chain proposed comprises all development stages, starting from the requirements specification, and concluding with the system implementation on a hardware demonstrator prototype. The demonstrator consists of ECUs coupled via CAN, as well as HIL interfaces for test case applications. We give detailled insights in selected imple- mentation issues, workarounds required, and the configuration steps needed for the AUTOSAR operating system. A discussion of the pro's and con's regarding the potential of AUTOSAR concludes.},

abstract = {In product line engineering, systems are developed in families and differences between family members are expressed in terms of features. Formal modelling and verification is an important issue in this context as more and more critical systems are developed this way. Since the number of systems in a family can be exponential in the number of features, two major challenges are the scalable modelling and the efficient verification of system behaviour. Currently, the few attempts to address them fail to recognise the importance of features as a unit of difference, or do not offer means for automated verification. In this paper, we tackle those challenges at a fundamental level. We first extend transition systems with features in order to describe the combined behaviour of an entire system family. We then define and implement a model checking technique that allows to verify such transition systems against temporal properties. An empirical evaluation shows substantial gains over classical approaches.},

After a brief description of the theoretical basis of the method, experimental results are presented which show estimation of the inertial properties is possible. The results validate the accuracy and applicability of the method and illustrate that the vehicle inertial properties can be obtained even when certain system parameters, such as damping coefficients, are assumed unknown.},

abstract = {Dynamic Software Product Line (DSPL) provides a new paradigm for developing self-adaptive systems with the principles of software product line engineering. DSPL emphasizes variability analysis and design at development time and variability binding and reconfiguration at runtime, thus requires some kinds of variability mechanisms to map high-level variations (usually represented by features) to low-level implementation and support runtime reconfiguration. Existing work on DSPL usually assumes that variation features can be directly mapped to coarse-grained elements like services, components or plug-ins, making the methods hard to be applied for traditional software systems. In this paper, we propose a feature-oriented method to support runtime variability reconfiguration in DSPLs. The method introduces the concept of role model, an intermediate level between feature variations and implementations to improve their traceability. On the other hand, the method involves a reference implementation framework based on dynamic aspect mechanisms to implement the runtime reconfiguration. We illustrate the process of applying the proposed method with a concrete case study, which helps to validate the effectiveness of our method. 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

While the foundations of this domain recently made significant progress with the introduction of Featured Transition Systems (FTSs) and associated algorithms, SPL model checking still faces the well-known state explosion problem. Moreover, there is a need for high-level specification languages usable in industry. We address the state explosion problem by applying the principles of symbolic model checking to FTS-based verification of SPLs. In order to specify properties on specific products only, we extend the temporal logic CTL with feature quantifiers. Next, we show how SPL behaviour can be specified with fSMV, a variant of SMV, the specification language of the industry-strength model checker NuSMV. fSMV is a feature-oriented extension of SMV originally introduced by Plath and Ryan. We prove that fSMV and FTSs are expressively equivalent. Finally, we connect these results to a NuSMV extension we developed for verifying SPLs against CTL properties. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The torque gap filler consists of an additional mechanical link between the engine and the transmission output shaft, thus enabling the engine power to flow through this parallel path also when the launch clutch is disengaged, with clear benefits in terms of both sportiness and passenger comfort. This paper is the first part of a two-part study which, after a general description of the transmission architecture and its working principle, examines a practical implementation of the torque gap filler concept; the additional mechanical components and their integration into a traditional automated manual transmission are presented. Then, kinematic analysis and dynamic analysis of the transmission are proposed. The evolution of the transmission speeds are studied in the whole working range of the vehicle; the equations of motion are derived and used to show the effect of the torque gap filler on the torque transmitted to the wheels and consequently on the vehicle acceleration during gearshifts. The companion paper (Part 2) covers control issues and provides experimental validation.},

While this transformation has driven major advancements in efficiency and safety, it has also introduced a range of new potential risks. In this paper we experimentally evaluate these issues on a modern automobile and demonstrate the fragility of the underlying system structure. We demonstrate that an attacker who is able to infiltrate virtually any Electronic Control Unit (ECU) can leverage this ability to completely circumvent a broad array of safety-critical systems. Over a range of experiments, both in the lab and in road tests, we demonstrate the ability to adversarially control a wide range of automotive functions and completely ignore driver inputdash including disabling the brakes, selectively braking individual wheels on demand, stopping the engine, and so on. We find that it is possible to bypass rudimentary network security protections within the car, such as maliciously bridging between our car's two internal subnets. We also present composite attacks that leverage individual weaknesses, including an attack that embeds malicious code in a car's telematics unit and that will completely erase any evidence of its presence after a crash. Looking forward, we discuss the complex challenges in addressing these vulnerabilities while considering the existing automotive ecosystem.},

abstract = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers {\&} results.},

Discrete-event systems are modeled by automata together with a mechanism for enabling and disabling a subset of state transitions. The basic problem of interest is to ensure by appropriate supervision that the closed loop behavior of the system lies within a given legal behavior. Assuming this behavior can be decomposed into an intersection of component restrictions, we determine conditions under which it is possible to synthesize the appropriate control in a modular fashion.},

For fully electric vehicles with multiple electric motor drives, the enhancements can be achieved through a control allocation algorithm for the determination of the wheel torque distribution. This article analyzes alternative cost functions developed for the allocation of the wheel torques for a four-wheel-driven fully electric vehicle with individually controlled motors. Results in terms of wheel torque and tire slip distributions among the four wheels, and of input power to the electric drivetrains as functions of lateral acceleration are presented and discussed in detail. The cost functions based on minimizing tire slip allow better control performance than the functions based on energy efficiency for the case-study vehicle.},

NL is intrinsically ambiguous, and this is seen as a possible source of problems in the later interpretation of requirements. However, ambiguity or under-specification at requirements level can in some cases give an indication of possible variability, either in design choice, in implementation choices or configurability. Taking into account the results of previous analyses conducted on different requirements documents with NL analysis tools, we attempt a first classification of the forms of ambiguity that indicate variation points, and we indicate an approach to achieve automated support to variability elicitation.},

abstract = {Many of the timing constraints expressed in physical prescriptions of distributed systems and multi-clock electronic systems can be expressed in logical concepts. A logical time model has been developed as a part of the official OMG UML profile MARTE, in order to enrich the formalism of this profile and also to facilitate the description and analysis of temporal constraints. This time model is associated with CCSL (Clock Constraint Specification Language). Once the software is modeled, the difficulty lies in both expressing the relevant properties and in verifying them formally. We present an automatic transformation technique related to a method for verifying properties by model checking, thus exploiting both the CDL language (Context Description Language) and the OBP tool (Observer-based Prover). The technique is based on a translation of MARTE models and the CCSL constraints into Fiacre code. CDL can express predicates and observers. These are verified during the exhaustive exploration of the complete model by OBP. We illustrate our contribution by an illustrative case. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

To this end, existing concepts for nonblocking abstractions such as natural observers and marked string accepting (msa)-observers are extended by local control consistency (LCC) as a novel sufficient condition for maximal permissiveness. Furthermore, it is shown that, similar to the natural observer condition and the msa-observer condition, also LCC can be formulated in terms of a quasi-congruence. Based on existing algorithms in the literature, this allows to algorithmically compute natural projections that are either natural observers or msa-observers and that additionally fulfill LCC. The obtained results are illustrated by the synthesis of nonblocking and maximally permissive supervisors for a manufacturing system.},

@article{Rosenmuller2011,
abstract = {Software product lines (SPLs) and adaptive systems aim at variability to cope with changing requirements. Variability can be described in terms of features, which are central for development and configuration of SPLs. In traditional SPLs, features are bound statically before runtime. By contrast, adaptive systems support feature binding at runtime and are sometimes called dynamic SPLs (DSPLs). DSPLs are usually built from coarse-grained components, which reduces the number of possible application scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we closely integrate static binding of traditional SPLs and runtime adaptation of DSPLs. We achieve this integration by statically generating a tailor-made DSPL from a highly customizable SPL. The generated DSPL provides only the runtime variability required by a particular application scenario and the execution environment. The DSPL supports self-configuration based on coarse-grained modules. We provide a feature-based adaptation mechanism that reduces the effort of computing an optimal configuration at runtime. In a case study, we demonstrate the practicability of our approach and show that a seamless integration of static binding and runtime adaptation reduces the complexity of the adaptation process.

The principle of the algorithm is to iteratively strengthen the guards of the plant EFA so that forbidden or blocking states become unreachable in the controlled plant. As a consequence of the algorithm, the controlled behavior is modeled by an EFA having the same structure as the plant EFA, having stronger guards and is shown to be maximally permissive.

%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.
